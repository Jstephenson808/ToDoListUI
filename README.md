# Do Me 
This is the frontend UI for my To Do list application. It uses React and is fully test driven.
This UI interfaces with the Spring back end API.

## Add 

Currently you can add new To Dos and they will be persisted to the database using a service class.

## Delete 

This ui will display next to the ToDos and allows them to be deleted from the database.

## CI/Deployment 

Currently deployed on [Heroku](https://fela-kuti-ui.herokuapp.com/) with Travis CI.

## Development plans

Need to add some kind of notion of users as right now its just one massive list anyone can add to .
